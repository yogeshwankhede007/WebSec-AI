## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:yogeshwankhede007/WebSec-AI.git
cd WebSec-AI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📋 Requirements

- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- Target web application URL

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Run all security tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/critical/  # Critical security tests
python -m pytest tests/high/     # High priority tests

# Run individual test modules
python -m pytest tests/critical/authentication.py
python -m pytest tests/critical/authorization.py
python -m pytest tests/critical/session_management.py
python -m pytest tests/high/api_security.py
python -m pytest tests/high/data_protection.py
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

Our framework provides comprehensive coverage of critical security aspects:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Password policies
   - Session management
   - Access control
   - MFA implementation

2. **API Security**
   - Endpoint authentication
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - Response sanitization

3. **Data Protection**
   - Data encryption
   - Data integrity
   - Access control
   - Retention policies

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

- All tests are non-destructive by default
- Rate limiting for aggressive tests
- Proper error handling and logging
- Secure credential management

## 📝 Test Results

Test results are provided in a structured format:
```python
{
    "test_name": "Test Name",
    "status": "PASSED/FAILED/ERROR",
    "details": "Detailed test results"
}
```
